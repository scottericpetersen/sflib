# sflib
This is the historical "sflib" from the Eastman Computer Music Center (now [EARS](https://www.esm.rochester.edu/ears/)), a collection of instrumental sound samples collected and/or performed and recorded by former director Allan Schindler and his students.

The only difference between this and the canonical sflib is the removal of the "listening" folder which contained two commercial recordings, Babbitt's *Philomel* and Xenakis's *Gendy 3*.

All samples are 44.1k/16-bit. The 96k samples exist as an independent repository [here](https://github.com/scottericpetersen/sflib96).
