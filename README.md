# sflib
This is the historical "sflib" from the Eastman Computer Music Center (ECMC, now EARS), a collection of instrumental sound samples collected and/or performed and recorded by former director Allan Schindler and his students.

The only difference between this and the canonical sflib is the "listening" folder which contained two commercial recordings, Babbitt's *Philomel* and Xenakis's *Gendy 3*.
